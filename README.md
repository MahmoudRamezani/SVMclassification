# SVMclassification

In the first part, a Support Vector Machine algorithm is implemented on a breast cancer dataset.  The aim of this classification is to find if a case is cancerous/Malignant or not/Benign. 
In the second part of this code, we use Principle Component Analysis (PCA) to find the first two principal components, and visualize the data in this new, two-dimensional space, with a single scatter-plot. Althogh PCA is not a classification algorithm, by using the new representation of the data, we can choose a hyperplane to classify the data in a very simple way.
